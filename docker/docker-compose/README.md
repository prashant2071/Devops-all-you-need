# Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Benefits
1. Tool to create / manage multiple containers.
2. Avoid lots of human errors.
3. Docker compose file will be part of the repository.
4. So developer can use this file to run container and it will be version controlled.
5. Infrastructure as a code.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1. Defining the apps environment with `Dockerfile`.
2. Defining the services that make up app in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Start and run application service with `docker-compose up`.

Details can be studied from docker official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
